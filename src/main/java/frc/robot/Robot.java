  // has two Talon motors. The number in the parenthesis is the corresponding PWM
  // port on the RoboRIO

  // The first line tells the robot about where to find the left motor, and the 
  // second tells the robot about the right motor. I named them l1 (for left) 
  // and r1 (for right), but you can really name it whatever you want, as long
  // as it's easy to understand what each name means on the robot. One commonly
  // used format is to use abbreviate left as l and right as r, and add numbers
  // to designate between different left and right motors on the drivebase

  // Now that you have two motors, it's time to make them work together. By creating
  // a DiffferentialDrive object, you are telling the robot that the two motors (l1 
  // and r1) are a pair, and that they should work together as a drive train. We often
  // name this DifferentialDrive object dT, which stands for 'drive train'
  DifferentialDrive dT = new DifferentialDrive(l1, r1);

  // Remember moving the joystick to Port 0 on the FRC Driver Station? This is where
  // the port is set. By creating a new Joystick, we tell the robot that the drivebase
  // is controlled by a Logitech Controller. We name the driving controller 'driver' and

    // we have to reverse one of the motor's directions so they aren't spinning in opposite

    // robot's motors, by 'inverting' its direction

    // (dT). The first part in the parenthesis and before the comma controls the forwards 
    // and backwards movement on the robot. The second part in the parenthesis after the
    // comma takes the joystick input and translates it into turning movement. The 0.8
    // means that the motors run at 80% of the maximum CIM motor speed. Generally, it's
    // not a good idea to set this number above 80%, since running the motors too fast
    // can cause issues.
